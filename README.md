## Data Analyst Nanodegree Project: Create a Tableau Story

This project involved choosing a dataset, creating a Tableau story with that data and revising that story for each person that provided
feedback on it. The goal was to be able to highlight the key findings of the data in the clearest way possible,
using visual encodings and design choices. The dataset I used contained information on about 1,000 baseball players, including their
handedness (left-handed, right-handed, or ambidextrous), height, weight, batting average and number of home runs they hit.

Files in this repository:

* `Home Runs Viz Calculation.Rmd` - code for finding low and high home run numbers. Not necessary for understanding project.
* `Home Runs Viz Report.pdf` - report detailing design choices and feeback received for different versions of the story. Also contains
links to each draft on Tableau Public.
* `baseball_data.csv` - dataset used in all Tableau files.
